    "## Classes\n",
    "Classes are the builing blocks of object oriented programming languages like Python.  They are simply a way to bundel data and methods specific to that data together.  We have been using classes lots already. A simple example is a string like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`str1 = \"Hello\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "We originally just refered to this as a data type but it's actually a class as ther are alot of functions that can operate on `str1` which we access with the `.` notation, for example: `str.capitalize`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are a useful way of keeping your code understandable by keeping functions and the data they operate on together so functions can't be misused.  You can think of it being a bit like modules for data.\n",

    "Decorators are often used for things like controling access to functions with decorators like `login_required` or `staff_only` which will ask for the user to login before running or check the users status before allowing access. It's easy to see how useful these are for general programming but what can scientists use them for?  One good use case is to use a decorator to output the input and output of functions for debugging.  It ise useful to have this with a flag that turns it on and off so you can run the code in debug mode for any specific functions just by adding the decorator to their definitions.\n",
