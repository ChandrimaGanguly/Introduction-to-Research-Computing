    "# Good practice for coding\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing code to solve science prioblems it is very easy to aim to do \\*just\\* enough to get the answer you need.  It always feels like the fastest thing to do at the time, and at the time it may well be.  Unfortunatly what usually happens is the problem you started solving presents new problems and they present new problems and the code you started with then gets added to, and added to, and added to, to solve all these extra problems.  The result it that your original 'quick and dirty' code becomes your 'long, slow, un-readable, fragile mess' code.  You then find that you have to spent more and more time debugging it and trying to remember exactly what all the different parts do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other problem is that you may find that you code is in fact quite useful and you may want to share it with collaborators or students but unfortunatly as it's a 'long, slow, un-readable, fragile mess' no-one else can understand any of it, let alone make it work, and they end up having to write their own 'long, slow, un-readable, fragile messes' to duplicate yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is certainly the experence I had with my own code which is now over 50,000 lines long and comprises 29 different executables of which only about 12 still work.  So, with with the benefit of hindsight, the goal of this section is to help you to write code that is readable and maintainable.  And, once you have solved what you need to solve, can be shared with the world with you head help high.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing I need to teach you is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will often do very very stupid things\n",
    "\n",
    "My worst was typing `rm *` then, when going for the shift to add `Out` to remove my output files, instead bumped `enter` irreversably deleting my entire code base. On a smaller scale you will often find that when writing coding you will sometime convert working code to broken code and you won't know why and you wont be ablt to get it back to how it was (this will happen alot).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefor the most important part of good coding practice is:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "In it's simplest form verision control takes snpshots of your code at different stages and saves it so you can wind back to earlier versions if a problem arises.  It also allows you to branch your code so you can try new approaches while leaving the original version safe.  It also allows multiple people to work on a given code at the same time and for them to resolve the conflicts that arise when they edit the same files..\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will introduce you to `git` (there are others but git is an industry standard and used widely, ~70%). git is a distributed and decentralised version control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You can run it locally on your desktop just for yourself (You will want to make sure this is a machine that has a backup service)\n",
    "-   Or you can upload you repository to a git hosting site like github (private for cam address), bitbucket and gitlab.  the UIS also has git repositories.  This makes it easy for a team to work on the code and also gives you an off site backup.\n",
    "- Git will scale to just about any size you can think of (sometimes needs a small extra effort)\n",
    "- Using git opens door to industrial best practices and peer-to-peer software ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "On thing to consider when choosing a hosting site is data protection.  If you are working with sensitive data you may want your repository to be private. This can be done on all the above options.  Github will allow private accounts for \n",
    ".cam email addresses (but this will expire when you graduate). Bitbucket also allows unlimited private repositories for small teams. Gitlab allows local hosting  https://git.maths.cam.ac.uk/users/sign_in and the UIS service is naturally cambridge only https://git.uis.cam.ac.uk/x/maths/.\n",

Once you have a stable version you all like you branch it out as a 'release' of the code which saves it for eternity.  This works for small users.  For larger numbers you may mostly work on a branch then only commit back to master after checking for evil merges.  Often in large groups only senior developers would be able to commit to master.\n",

    "The first works for small teams who all know what the others are doing but saving code snapshots into versions makes it easy to find later (this is good for archiving code associated with specific data releases for experements).  Its pretty clean but will struggle when you have a large number of people.  The second is safer as you can work on your changes seperatly but because you are fairly independent merges can be trickier.\n",
