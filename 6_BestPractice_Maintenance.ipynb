    "# Good practice for coding\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know how to control the development of our code we need to think about how to write the code itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this section it to help you to write code that is readable and maintainable.  There is a well known addage which is: \"The older code gets the more it starts to stink\".  When we start projects it is always tempting to just get on with it.  Initally we know what we are doing and while we are starting out the code is fairly short and usually only does one or two things.  The problems only emerge a year or two down the line.  By now you will have modified your routines several times and added multiple new features.  The code will be long, messy and will likely contain redundant routines you are keeping \"just in case\".  Most likely there will be multiple sections that only work properly if you get the input just right.  Now editing the code has become a nightmare.  The code is too large to keep in your head so you can't quite remember exactly how every part works and which parts depend on each other.  Hence when you edit it you tend to introduce bugs that are then hard to track down.  Also you may wish to share the code with a collaborator so they can use for some new project but you have to spend a significant portion of every day trying to explain how it works and what bits they can edit safely.  The following ideas are all about stopping this happening.  \n",

    "There are three main things we will focus on \n",
    "- Documentation\n",
    "- Modularity\n",
    "- Prototyping\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two ensure readablity of your code so that others (and yourself) can follow what it does.  One of the great strengths of python is that its syntax closely follows normal English so it is easily readable, your code should be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first, and most important, topic in this section is documentation.  When you write code you should always so that it is clear exactly what it is that you are doing and why.  The goal for good documentation should be this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>\"If I die tomorrow, no-one should care\"</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence your code should be so easy to follow anyone could read and understand it without any help from you.  Let's look at functions first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has something called the 'Docstring' which is a comment immediatly after the `def` line and is what is returned with `functionname?`.  This should be a short description of the function and how to use it.  Here is a popular format:"

    "There are some basic conventions for naming things in python.  `i,j,k` are dummy integers, `x,y,z` are dummy floats, variables and functions are named in lower case with underscores (i.e. `obj_count` or `matrix_inv`), classes use camelcase (i.e. PointParticle).  You should avoid using `l`, `I` or `O` as they look like `1` and `0` in some fonts. You can't start a variable with a number and if some variables are related then you could give them the same prefix (e.g `loop_start, loop_end, loop_count`).  You should also use white space to make things clearer.  Generally put space around binary operators and space around lower priority operations e.g."

    "\n",
    "The next thing you should do to make your code readable is to break it up into discreate blocks each of which excecutes one 'idea' by moving detailed calculation into functions and modules.  We met this idea when we first met modules earlier.  This makes the code more readable as you can see its structure without getting bogged down in detail.  It also generally makes it more stable and easier to edit as you can work on discrete blocks in isolation.  Finally it allows code reuse.  Once you have written a module that say, reads and processes your particular data set, you can use it everywhere and if you then find a bug in it you only have to fix it in one place.\n",

    "1. Each routine should to be not more than one screen long.\n",
    "2. Any code that you will use in more than one place should be moved to a seperate routine.\n",
    "3. Routines should only have one main task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first makes your code more readable and makes it harder to get 'lost'. It also makes editing safer as each part is understandable on its own.  The second not only saves time but means that if you want to change something you only need to do it once.  The third means that you only have to worry about what else you might be breaking when you edit something.  All of these rules can be broken if it makes your code simpler or clearer. There is also a risk that if code is very heavily modulised then it can be hard to find where calculations actually happen and can even slow down your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prototyping\n",
    "\n",
    "One other important coding practice is prototyping.  Prototyping is simply deciding what you are going to do, then checking that your ideas work, before launching into writing the detailed code for your problem.  The temptation is always to \"just get to work\" and start coding.  The problem with this approach is that once you start coding in a particular direction when you meet issues it can be hard to go back and fix our original bad decisions rather than just finding a workaround for the particular issue.  The analogy is if you start building a car but discover halfday through that where you want to drive is very muddy. So you go back and add bigger grippier tyres but then you find the car doesn't have the tourqe to turn them. To solve this you install a low range gearbox but then the engine can't handle it so you add a second engine to boost power...   At the end of this you will end up with a weird mish-mash car when really you should have gone back to the start and made a tractor instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best place to start prototyping is with a pen and paper.  As almost all programming we are going to do is related to data processing the first thing to do is to think about what data objects you are going to need starting from input data and the final results you want to output. Next you have to decide how to get between the two in the most efficent manner and what data objects you will need on the way.  With this we can slowly build up a plan for the code.  Here is a list of things you should consider when you prototype:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the size of the problem? Do I need to worry about memory/parallelisation/architecture constraints for this code?\n",
    "2. What does my input data look like and what data do I want to output?\n",
    "3. What logical operations do I need to perform on the data?\n",
    "4. Can I map the operations onto standard optimised routines from numpy/scipy/etc...?\n",
    "5. What temporary data objects will I need to create?\n",
    "6. What is a sensible naming convention for my data objects/variables? (more important than it sounds)\n",
    "7. How should I modularise this, what might I want to reuse from here in other future codes?\n",
    "8. What should the inputs and outputs of each module be?\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to be reasonably detailed, the goal is to identify roadblocks with your method and if they were obvious from a rough plan you would have already thought of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to make small models to test parts of the code to make sure your ideas work.  Our tests should check the method works, that is is accurate and also what the memory and CPU requirments wiil be for the full problem size.  Not everything needs this kind of check but you should try to do it with any section you are unsure about.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So far this has been very theoretical, let's try a worked example to see the ideas in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Suppose you want to calculate a multidimensional sum over some combination of functions, $X^i_{l}$, but with some particular constraints:\n",

    "$E_{ijk} = \\sum_{l_1}\\sum_{l_2}\\sum_{l_3} \\left( \\int_{-1}^{1} d\\mu P_{l_1}(\\mu) P_{l_2}(\\mu) P_{l_3}(\\mu)  \\right) X^i (l_1) X^j (l_2) X^k (l_3) $\n",
