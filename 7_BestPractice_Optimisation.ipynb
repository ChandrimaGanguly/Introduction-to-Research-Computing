For the code calculating the integral in the previous notebook you may want to to create tests that check you polynomials are OK (by checking orthonormality) or that the final integral with Gauss-Legendre quadriture is correct for large l (ie set X = $\\delta_{l,200}$ and see if you get the correct answer, 0.000018285996687338485).  \n",

    "\n",
    "Modern CPU's are so fast that actually most optimisatising for high performance computing comes from optimising memory usage to make sure the CPU is fed with enough data.  These are three numbers listed for each section in the above plot: Latency, which is how long it takes to respond to a command; Bandwidth, which is how past it can pass data up the chain; Size, which is how much data can be stored there.  The main problem we see is that memory latency is ~200 times longer than CPU latency (which is 1 cycle).  So, if you want to multiply two numbers it takes 200 times as long to get them to the CPU as it does to multiply them.  The response to this was to introduce multiple layers of faster and faster, but smaller and smaller, memory inbetween the CPU and main memory called 'cache'.  This helps keep data that we are working on close to the CPU so if we want to use it we can without delay.  This means that there are two things we can do to speed up our code.\n",

    "Firstly, in python we don't actually have much control over what the computer does at the instruction level.  This is a shame as often it is possible to speed up some calculations by orders of magnitude just by using simple directives to compilers in lower level languages like C anf Fortran.  This is why it is so important to use packages in python where this type of optimisation should already have been done for you.  Another key point is that you should try to use packages what have been build for your CPU (check this with `lscpu`), for example making sure you install the intel distribution for intel chips with:\n",

    "There are always many different ways to do the same calculation so you should get into the habit of checking which is fastest.

However, in python we see that while exponentiation is slower than multiplying, multipling is the same as adding.  Multiplying by a number is faster than multiplying by a variable as we don't have to go and find the number it in memory and multipliing two numbers much faster again.  We can roughly conclude that it takes twice as long to find a variable as it does to multiply it (you can read faster than find the right bit of a book). In python division and muliplication take the same time.  This is because most of the time is lost in finding the variables rather than the operation itself.  But if we do the operation alot:"
